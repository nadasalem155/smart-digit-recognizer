# üìò Smart Digit Recognizer

Digit recognition using multiple Machine Learning models on the MNIST dataset, with training, evaluation, and performance comparison.  
Additionally, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model üñºÔ∏è was trained for improved accuracy, and a Streamlit-based web interface allows users to draw digits and get predictions in real-time.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source:** [MNIST 60,000 Handwritten Number Images (Train ) (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv)  
- **Used:** Training split (60,000 samples)  
- **Image size:** 28 √ó 28 pixels (flattened into 784 features)  
- **Target:** Digits 0‚Äì9

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Preparation**
   - Loaded dataset into a DataFrame.
   - Separated features (pixels) and target labels.
   - Renamed columns for clarity.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Checked class distribution (balanced dataset).
   - Visualized some sample digits.

3. **Preprocessing**
   - Normalized pixel values (0‚Äì255 ‚Üí 0‚Äì1).
   - Reshaped images to (28,28,1) for CNN input.
   - Split into training (80%) and validation (20%).

4. **Model Training**
   - Trained and compared five classical ML models:
     - üß† Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)  
     - üî§ Perceptron  
     - üå≥ Decision Tree  
     - üå≤ Random Forest  
     - ‚ö° XGBoost  
   - üñºÔ∏è Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on reshaped 28√ó28 images with data augmentation, achieving higher accuracy than classical ML models.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Measured Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
   - Compared results across all models.
   - **Best Machine Learning model:** MLPClassifier among the classical ML models.  
   - **Best overall model:** CNN, outperforming all other models in accuracy and metrics.
